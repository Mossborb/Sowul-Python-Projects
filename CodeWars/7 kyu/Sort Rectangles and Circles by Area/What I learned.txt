You can use the built in sort() function and give it 
a key and reverse parameters. 
The key will take a function you wrote and sort your list
based off of the results of a function. 

Also manipulating a list does not require reassigning
the list to it's self. 
making 

seq = seq.sort()

not recommended. 

Now I want to create sorting algorithms
